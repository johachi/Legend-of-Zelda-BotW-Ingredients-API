# CC8 SoloProject - API Solo Project
My first solo project during enrollment to Code Chrysalis.

### Objectives
- [ ] Create a CRUD API service using Express/GraphQL, Knex, and Postgres
- [ ] Use test-doubles from Mocha or Jasmine to test my code
- [x] Seed my database with interesting data
- [ ] Be able to document your API endpoints for other developers to use
- [ ] Create a Basic/Simple Frontend e.g. API Documentation
### Summary
I only had one weekend (two days) to create an MVP (minimum viable product).
I also have to do a 5 minute presentation of your API on Monday morning (2019/4/29).

### Requirements
##### Alternative 1
- [ ] A script that will set up and seed a database
An Express server that:
  - [ ] serves up a basic HTML file that describes your API service
  - [x] has a create endpoint for adding to your database (POST)
  - [x] has a read endpoint for reading from your database (GET)
  - [ ] has an update endpoint for editing to your database (PATCH/PUT)
  - [ ] has a delete endpoint for deleting from your database (DELETE)
 
##### Alternative 2

- [ ] a GraphQL Server that:
  - [ ] serves up a basic HTML file that describes your API service
  - [ ] Has multiple types to query
  - [ ] Offers mutations to delete, add, or modify data
  - [ ] A basic HTML file that gets served up. It should have the name of your API and link to your API's GitHub folder
  - [ ] Migration files
  - [ ] Tests with usage of test-doubles
  - [ ] Documentation in the form of a README.md file => https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme
  - [ ] The top of your readme should say “This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis”
  - [ ] A 5 minute presentation including a demo

### Advanced Requirements
- [ ] Deployed on Heroku (optional)
