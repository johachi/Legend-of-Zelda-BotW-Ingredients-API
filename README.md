# CC8 SoloProject - API Solo Project
My first solo project during enrollment to Code Chrysalis.

### Objectives
- [x] Create a CRUD API service using Express/GraphQL, Knex, and Postgres
- [x] Use test-doubles from Mocha or Jasmine to test my code
- [x] Seed my database with interesting data
- [ ] Be able to document your API endpoints for other developers to use
- [x] Create a Basic/Simple Frontend e.g. API Documentation
### Summary
I only had one weekend (two days) to create an MVP (minimum viable product).
I also have to do a 5 minute presentation of your API on Monday morning (2019/4/29).
Due to private mather, I was only able to work on this API for one day.
